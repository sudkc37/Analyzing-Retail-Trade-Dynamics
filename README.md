Concentrated on each exchangeâ€™s observations and trading of each form of RPI with regard to price, time, and volatility. I used sub-penny increments or mid-quotes as an indicator and filtered data accordingly to determine that the trade truly accrued at RPI. Trades on the exchanges for the Bats(Y), NASDAQ(B), NYSE Arca(P), and NYSE(N) occur in sub-penny increments. Additionally, trade only takes place at mid-quotes on the IEX. 
Investigated two categories of assets: ETSs and individual stock. I selected SPY as a ETF and American Airlines (AAL) as a stock. 
ETFs are the most RPI traded stocks, it is difficult to discern RPI kinds only by looking at these graphs. But if we look closely, the majority of observed RPI are two-sided. It is difficult to determine whether volatility or time, or jointly have any impact on the RPIs, unless there are some exceptions (unusual trade which we were lucky to observe on further analysis). Comparatively, the two-sided RPI is evident in a variety of ways.
